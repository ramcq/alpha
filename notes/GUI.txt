DOCUMENTATION ON USER INTERFACE DESIGN (UI):

TEAM: ALPHA
[by Neofytos]

INTRODUCTION:
	
Any program delivered to a client (namely the user) must be accompanied with a friendly, 
easy to use user interface. When we say user interface we usually refer to a program that 
controls a display for the user (usually on a computer monitor) and that allows the user 
to interact with the system. A system can be said to be truly user-friendly if the first 
time user can make use of it without continual reference to a manual.So it is vital that 
the design of the user interface should be carefully planned taking all parameters into 
consideration.


COMPONENTS:

	First we will split our UI into different components so that we can manage and 
implement them more easily.

*	The menu bar which will include the following options:

	1.	Algorithm. The user by clicking on this option will be given the chance 
		to choose which algorithm he wishes to see animated. The selection of 
		algorithms will include the algorithms specified in the specification document.

	2.	Help. The user can get help on the spot without reference to the user manual.

	3.	Links. Possible links to webpages that contain animation material for algorithms.
	
	4.	what more can we add??


*	The main screen where the algorithm gets animated.


IDEAS:

	It would be nice when the shell begins to have a nice graphical display on the screen 
as shown on diagram 1. Maybe we can achieve this by the use of a simple applet within the shell 
application that just prints on the screen.

	When the user chooses an algorithm (by the use of the mouse, donï¿½t think it is essential 
to have keyboard shortcuts) then the screen appearance changes and it looks like diagram 2. If 
the user chooses to run a sorting algorithm then he will be prompted to specify the input data 
by placing integers inside each box. Otherwise a button will give the option of filling up the 
boxes with random data. Similarly, if the user chooses to run a graph algorithm then he will be 
prompted with number of nodes but specifying somehow that the number can not exceed the number 
stated in the specification document.
After doing this, there will be two buttons, the first one corresponding to run automatically 
(i.e the machine will run the animating algorithm at reasonable speed to completion) and the 
second one corresponding to run manually (namely the user can step through the algorithm at 
his own speed).

	Either of the two run buttons chosen, the animation will begin appearing on the main 
screen. However the input data should remain on the screen so that the user can reference to 
if he wishes. This will aid comprehension since he can see the initial configuration of data 
and compare with the subsequent phases. See diagram 3. 
If the user wishes to step through the algorithm then the presence of a button labelled next 
will be present at the bottom of the animation.
The presence of the stop button will enable the user to stop the current algorithm running 
and the screen goes back to a state as that proposed when the shell loads.
